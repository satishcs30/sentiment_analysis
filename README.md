**Social Media Analysis**

This project tackles the issue of sentiment analysis in Twitter, which entails categorizing
tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories based on the sentiment expressed in them and
providing suitable recommendations. Twitter is a social networking and microblogging website that allows users to post short status updates of
up to 140 characters. It is a rapidly growing service, with over 200 million registered users- of which 100
million are active users, with half of them logging in daily - and approximately 250 million tweets every
day. We intend to obtain a representation of public sentiment by analyzing the feelings conveyed in the
tweets to gain some insights. As a use case we will analyze the consumer posts, comments, and reviews
on Samsung Galaxy S8, iPhone 8, and iPhone X models to identify pre/post launch sentiment around
these products and provide recommendations to companies on their next releases.
